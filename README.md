## ws2812b Ambilight + remote control for LEDs and PC

  This repository is dedicated to document this project I made for my PC setup.
### Items used:
  **Arduino Uno.\
  178 cm of 100 LEDs/m 5v ws2812b LED Strips (178 LEDs Total).\
  40A 5v Power Supply (to power the LEDs).\
  KY-022 Infrared Reciever.\
  330 Î© Resistor\
  And a lot of wires...**


### The project has **3** main targets:
  **Controlling the LEDs with a .NET program on the PC.**\
  **Controlling the PC with a remote control**\
  **Controlling the LEDs with a remote control.**

### Circuit Diagram:
  Below is the circuit diagram:
